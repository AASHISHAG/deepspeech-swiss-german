# Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) - DeepSpeech Swiss German

_This is the project for the paper [LTL-UDE at Low-Resource Speech-to-Text Shared Task : Investigating Mozilla DeepSpeech in a low-resource setting]() published at [SWISSTEXT 5th and KONVENS 2020](https://swisstext-and-konvens-2020.org/)._

This project aims to develop a working Speech to Text module using [Mozilla DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech), which can be used for any Audio processing pipeline. [Mozillla DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech) is a state-of-the-art open-source automatic speech recognition (ASR) toolkit. DeepSpeech is using a model trained by machine learning techniques based on [Baidu's Deep Speech](https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/deep_speech3_12_17.pdf) research paper. Project DeepSpeech uses Google's TensorFlow to make the implementation easier.
